sol.cpp     - an optimal solution. The output is always in normal form.
            This file also contains a helper method to check correctness.
testgen.py  - contains tools to generate test data.

Fibonacci representation is in normal form if
- the rightmost digit is 0
- the 3rd digit from the right is 0
- there are no neighboring 1's
- there are no leading 0's

The normal form is unique.
